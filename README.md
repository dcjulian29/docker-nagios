This is a docker container that I use to deploy nagios to various environments for monitoring. Sometimes it is for whole network monitoring and sometimes it is simple inter-cluster application monitoring.
This image currently is a monolithic image containing all of the plugins/checks for all environment. Possibly plan to update to a base image with additional images specialized to more specific environments... Other plan is to convert to a multi-stage build to reduce end image layer sizes which may make prior plan mute.
